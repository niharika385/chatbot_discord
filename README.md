simple discord bot that would reply hey to your hi.
If the user types !google nodejs, reply with top 5 links that you would get when you search nodejs on google.com
If a user uses !google to search for "nodejs" "apple games" "game of thrones", and after these searches, if user types !recent game, your bot should reply with "apple games" and "game of thrones"
